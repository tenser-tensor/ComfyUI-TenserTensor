A collection of custom nodes for ComfyUI that streamline common workflows. The main goal is to reduce visual clutter by
combining frequently used node chains into single, convenient loaders.

## Features

- **Workflow settings nodes** - configure entire workflow parameters (basic and advanced variants)
- **All-in-one model loaders** - load checkpoint, LoRAs, CLIP, and VAE in single nodes
- **Latent factory** - generate latents with aspect ratio, megapixel count, orientation, and type selection (Flux/SDXL)
- **Context nodes** - from Basic to Even Larger Context
    - Basic: combines latent, model, CLIP, VAE, and workflow config into context
    - Others: pass-through nodes that modify specific context values while preserving the rest
- **CLIP text encoders** - context-based and prompt-based encoding with model-specific controls
- **KSamplers** - Different implementations of KSampler for generating images. Accepts all common sampling parameters
  and returns a denoised latent ready for VAE decoding.
- **VAE decoders** - basic, context-based, extended, and two-pass (draft + refinement)
- **Post-production tools** - image adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation), color correction (apply LUT), film
  grain, upscaler
    - All-in-one post-production node combining all tools
    - Simplified version without adjustments

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure your ComfyUI version is recent enough to properly support custom operations when loading UNET-only models.

### 1. Via Git Clone (recommended)

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/tenser-tensor/ComfyUI-TenserTensor
```

### 2. Via ComfyUI-Manager

* Open ComfyUI-Manager
* Click "Install Custom Nodes"
* Search for: TenserTensor
* Install → Restart ComfyUI

### 3. Via comfy-cli

```bash
comfy node install tenser-tensor/ComfyUI-TenserTensor
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation.
